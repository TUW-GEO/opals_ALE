# ALE
Advanced Line Editor for QGIS

This tool allows for fast editing of 2D and 3D lines and was developed especially for manual editing of topological breaklines (cf. https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/showentry.php?ID=261893 (german))
Tools include:
* Connecting two lines (while preserving Z-Coordinates)
* Closing a line to a loop (while preserving Z-Coordinates)
* Splitting a line at a node, deleting two segments
* Splitting a line at a segment, deleting it
* Marking a line with an attribute ("Status")
